# GravitySimulator
Quick n-body gravitational simulator following known laws of physics

Basic Idea:
This program uses pygame for ease of graphics. A sample system of planet and moons is provided. Each mass can be deleted individually by clicking on the Info Box for that mass and hitting the red button.
The velocities of each mass can be changed in its respective Info Box: Enter x,y where x is the velocity in x direction and y is the velocity in the y direction then hit green button to confirm. 
Masses can be added by clicking where you want the new mass. A box will appear in the top left where you can enter the actual mass of the body you wish to add. Hit enter to add the new masses. 

Each mass has one red arrow and one green arrow. The red arrow is for acceleration and the green is for velocity with the magnitude and direction of each arrow being proportional to the actual velocity and mass of the body.

Enjoy the fruits of my boredom during winter break!
